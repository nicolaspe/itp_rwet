- 3 teaspoons of transportation
- 3 teaspoons of sanitation
- 2 oz. of rumors
- 2 fluid oz. of us

Shake transportation until your confidence resurfaces. Fill sanitation with rumors and fuck the opinion of critics. Pour into us and fuck the opinion of critics. Release transportation. Strive for your dreams. Fill the glasses with club soda, stir, and garnish with additional lime wedges.
